# Chess-Games-Analysis
This repository will contain all related content to my personal project - "Analysing 20,000 chess games". The goal of the project is to analyse a dataset containing 20,000 games of chess and use the findings to recommend the best openings to learn for a new player or a beginner-intermediate player.
